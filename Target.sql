-- 1.3 Write an SQL query to retrieve the top 5 orders by order count from the dataset Target.orders. Include the date of purchase, 
--the total count of orders for each date, and the start and end times of purchase for each date. Ensure that the orders are sorted in descending order based on the order count.
